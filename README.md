# Interview Task

Package ```customerimporter``` reads from a CSV file and returns a sorted (data
structure of your choice) of email domains along with the number of customers
with e-mail addresses for each domain. 

* Initialise a new git repository and commit your changes.
* Fix/Extend the project so that it runs from the CLI and output the sorted domains to the terminal or to a file. 
* Any errors should be logged and handled.
* Tests should pass.
* Performance matters (this is only ~3k lines, but could be 1m lines or run on a small machine).
* You are free to refactor/create anything the demonstrates how you build code.
